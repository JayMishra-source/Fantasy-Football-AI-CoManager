## 💡 **#1 Pick Strategy**

### Round 1 - Pick #1 🏆
**TARGET:** Christian McCaffrey (if healthy) or Tyreek Hill
- **RB Strategy**: Lock in an elite RB1 (McCaffrey, Saquon)  
- **WR Strategy**: Go for the #1 WR (Tyreek Hill, Jefferson)
- **Recommendation**: RB tends to be scarcer - go CMC if available

### Round 2 - Pick #32 
**32 picks later...** Fill your biggest remaining need
- If you took RB: Target elite WR (Jefferson, Hill, Chase)
- If you took WR: Target RB1 (Saquon, Henry, Cook)

### Round 3 - Pick #33 (Back-to-Back!)
**HUGE advantage** - you get consecutive picks!
- Fill remaining RB/WR need
- Consider elite TE (Kelce, Andrews) if great value
- Build your foundation with 2 solid picks

### Mid-Round Strategy (7-12)
