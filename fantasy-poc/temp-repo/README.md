{
  "mcpServers": {
    "espn-fantasy": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/fantasy-poc/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can ask Claude questions like:

### Roster Analysis
```
"Show me my fantasy roster"
"Analyze my team's strengths and weaknesses"
"What positions do I need to improve?"
```

### Lineup Optimization
```
"Optimize my lineup for this week"
"Should I start [Player Name] this week?"
"Who should I put in my flex position?"
```

### Waiver Wire
```
"Find the best available RBs on waivers"
"Should I pick up [Player Name]?"
"Who should I drop to make room?"
```

### Trade Analysis
```
"Is this trade fair: I give [Player A] for [Player B]?"
"Find me trade targets to improve my WR position"
"What players could I package for an elite RB?"
```

## Development

### Run in Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Test the Server Standalone

```bash
# Build first
npm run build

# Test with sample input
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}' | node dist/index.js
```

### Debugging

- Check Claude Desktop logs for connection issues
- Server logs errors to stderr (visible in Claude Desktop developer console)
- Ensure cookies are valid and not expired
- Verify league ID and team ID are correct

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication required" Error
- Your ESPN cookies have expired
- Get fresh cookies from browser
- Update .env file with new values

### "Team not found" Error
- Verify your team ID is correct
- Check that you have access to the league

### Claude Can't See the Server
- Ensure path in config is absolute, not relative
- Check that the built files exist in `dist/`
- Restart Claude Desktop after config changes

### No Data Returned
- League might be public (doesn't need auth)
- Try removing ESPN_S2 and ESPN_SWID for public leagues

## Privacy & Security

- Cookies are only stored locally in your .env file
- Never commit .env file to version control
- MCP server runs locally on your machine
- No data is sent to external services

## Next Steps

1. **Customize Analysis**: Modify tools in `src/tools/` for your league's scoring
2. **Add Scheduling**: Create scheduled analysis reports
3. **Historical Data**: Add past performance tracking
4. **Custom Strategies**: Implement your specific fantasy strategies
