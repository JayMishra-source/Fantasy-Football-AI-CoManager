# Cost Monitoring System

The LLM-agnostic fantasy automation now includes built-in cost monitoring with configurable limits and automatic alerts.

## üö® Automatic Alerts

The system automatically monitors your LLM usage costs and sends **Slack notifications** when limits are approached or exceeded.

### Default Limits

| Period | Default Limit | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Per Analysis | $1.00 | Prevents expensive single calls |
| Daily | $2.00 | Daily spending cap |
| Weekly | $10.00 | Weekly budget control |
| Monthly | $35.00 | Monthly cost management |

### Alert Types

- **üü° Approaching Limit**: 80%+ of limit used
- **üî¥ Limit Exceeded**: 100%+ of limit used
- **üö® Critical**: Per-analysis limit exceeded

## üìä Monitoring Tools

### MCP Tools (Use with Claude Desktop)

```bash
# Get current cost summary
get_cost_summary

# Get cost-optimized provider recommendations  
get_provider_recommendations

# Reset cost tracking (admin only)

```

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test cost monitoring system
npm run build
node test-cost-monitoring.js
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Cost limits (in USD)
COST_DAILY_LIMIT=2.00
COST_WEEKLY_LIMIT=10.00  
COST_MONTHLY_LIMIT=35.00
COST_PER_ANALYSIS_LIMIT=1.00

# Slack notifications
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url

## üìà Cost Tracking

### Data Storage

- Automatic cleanup and rotation

### Tracked Information

Each analysis logs:
- Provider and model used
- Cost in USD
- Tokens consumed
- Analysis type (lineup, waivers, etc.)
- NFL week number
- Timestamp

|----------|-------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Gemini** | gemini-1.5-flash | $0.01-0.03 | $0.04-0.12 | $0.16-0.48 |

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cost log file not found"**
- Normal on first run - file is created automatically

**"Slack notification failed"** 
- Check webhook URL is correct
- Verify webhook has permission to post to channel

**"High costs detected"**
- Review provider pricing
- Consider switching to cheaper model
- Check for unnecessary tool calls

### Reset Cost Tracking

```bash
# Via MCP tool
reset_cost_tracking

# Or manually delete
rm cost-log.json
```

## üì± Integration

### GitHub Actions

Cost monitoring is automatically included in the LLM-agnostic workflow:
- Costs are tracked for every automated analysis
- Alerts are included in Slack notifications
- Cost data is saved in workflow artifacts

### Claude Desktop

Use the MCP tools directly:
```
get_cost_summary
get_provider_recommendations
```

The cost monitoring system provides comprehensive protection against unexpected LLM costs while maintaining full transparency into your fantasy football automation spending.
