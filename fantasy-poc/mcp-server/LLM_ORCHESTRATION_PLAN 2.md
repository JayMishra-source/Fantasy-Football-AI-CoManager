# LLM-Orchestrated Fantasy Football Automation Plan

## Overview
Transform the current hardcoded MCP tool calls into intelligent LLM-orchestrated workflows where the AI makes strategic decisions using MCP tools as needed.

## Current Problems
- ❌ **Direct MCP tool calls** bypass LLM intelligence
- ❌ **No contextual reasoning** - just basic math
- ❌ **Hardcoded workflows** - no adaptive decision-making
- ❌ **Unused LLM system** - sophisticated infrastructure ignored

## Target Architecture
```
GitHub Actions → LLM Orchestrator → Dynamic MCP Tool Selection → AI Analysis → Rich Recommendations
```

## Workflow Transformations

### 1. Thursday - Pre-Game Lineup Optimization
**Current**: Direct `optimize_lineup` calls
**New**: LLM-driven strategic analysis

**New Command**:
```bash
echo "Optimize my lineup for both leagues for Week $CURRENT_WEEK. Focus on Thursday night games and injury reports." | node dist/ai-workflow.js --task=thursday_optimization --league1=$LEAGUE_ID_1:$TEAM_ID_1 --league2=$LEAGUE_ID_2:$TEAM_ID_2 --week=$CURRENT_WEEK > thursday_analysis.json
```

**LLM Strategy**: Analyze injury reports, weather, Thursday night implications, bye weeks, and matchups

### 2. Sunday - Final Lineup Adjustments  
**Current**: Repeat `optimize_lineup` calls
**New**: Real-time decision analysis

**New Command**:
```bash
echo "Review and finalize lineups for Week $CURRENT_WEEK. Focus on injury reports and last-minute changes since Thursday." | node dist/ai-workflow.js --task=sunday_check --league1=$LEAGUE_ID_1:$TEAM_ID_1 --league2=$LEAGUE_ID_2:$TEAM_ID_2 --week=$CURRENT_WEEK --previous=thursday_analysis.json > sunday_final.json
```

**LLM Strategy**: Compare Thursday recommendations with current situation, focus on late-breaking news

### 3. Monday - Post-Game Analysis & Waiver Strategy
**Current**: Separate `analyze_roster` and `find_waiver_targets` calls  
**New**: Comprehensive team evaluation and strategic planning

**New Command**:
```bash
echo "Analyze Week $CURRENT_WEEK performance and recommend waiver targets for both leagues. Focus on roster improvements and upcoming matchups." | node dist/ai-workflow.js --task=monday_analysis --league1=$LEAGUE_ID_1:$TEAM_ID_1 --league2=$LEAGUE_ID_2:$TEAM_ID_2 --week=$CURRENT_WEEK > monday_strategy.json
```

**LLM Strategy**: Performance review, roster gap analysis, strategic waiver targeting

### 4. Tuesday - Waiver Wire Execution
**Current**: Repeat `find_waiver_targets`
**New**: Adaptive strategy based on waiver results

**New Command**:
```bash
echo "Review waiver wire after Monday claims processed. Find new opportunities and adjust strategy for Week $((CURRENT_WEEK + 1))." | node dist/ai-workflow.js --task=tuesday_waivers --league1=$LEAGUE_ID_1:$TEAM_ID_1 --league2=$LEAGUE_ID_2:$TEAM_ID_2 --week=$CURRENT_WEEK --previous=monday_strategy.json > tuesday_waivers.json
```

**LLM Strategy**: Adapt to waiver results, find new opportunities, FAAB strategy

## What Changed

### Before (Rule-Based):
```bash
# Hardcoded tool calls
echo '{"name":"optimize_lineup",...}' | node dist/index.js
echo '{"name":"find_waiver_targets",...}' | node dist/index.js
```
- Just basic math on ESPN projections
- No contextual reasoning
- Static decision logic

### After (AI-Orchestrated):
```bash  
# Intelligent workflows
echo '{"name":"execute_ai_workflow","task":"thursday_optimization","prompt":"Optimize considering injuries and matchups",...}' | node dist/index.js
```
- LLM chooses which MCP tools to call
- Contextual reasoning and strategy
- Adaptive decision-making
- Rich insights and confidence scores

Your fantasy football management is now powered by true artificial intelligence! 🚀
