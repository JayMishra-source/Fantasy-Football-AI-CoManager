2. App obtains session cookies via headless browser (Puppeteer/Playwright)
3. Store encrypted cookies in database
4. Refresh cookies periodically to maintain access
5. Use cookies for all ESPN API requests
```

### 3.2 API Endpoints to Use
- League settings: `/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/{year}/segments/0/leagues/{leagueId}`
- Team rosters: `/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/{year}/segments/0/leagues/{leagueId}?view=mRoster`
- Player stats: `/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/{year}/segments/0/leagues/{leagueId}?view=kona_player_info`
- Transactions: `/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/{year}/segments/0/leagues/{leagueId}/transactions`

## 4. AI Decision-Making Framework

### 4.1 Lineup Optimization Algorithm
```python
factors = {
    'player_projection': 0.30,
    'opponent_defense_ranking': 0.20,
    'recent_performance': 0.15,
    'home_away': 0.10,
    'weather_conditions': 0.10,
    'injury_status': 0.15
}
```

### 4.2 Trade Evaluation Model
