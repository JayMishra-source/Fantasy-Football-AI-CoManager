## Best Practices

3. Review injury reports through `analyze_roster`
4. Consider weather and matchup data

### For Waiver Wire
1. Run `find_waiver_targets` every Tuesday
2. Focus on position needs identified by `analyze_roster`
3. Use FAAB recommendations from the analysis
4. Check player trends and snap counts

### For Trades
1. Always use `analyze_trade` before accepting/proposing
2. Check `find_trade_targets` to identify partners
3. Consider playoff schedule in trade evaluations
4. Balance immediate needs vs. long-term value

## Response Guidelines

### When Providing Recommendations
