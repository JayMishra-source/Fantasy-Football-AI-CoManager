```bash
cd fantasy-poc/mcp-server
npm install && npm run build

# Add to Claude Desktop config (~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json):
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "espn-fantasy": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/fantasy-poc/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "ESPN_S2": "your_cookie",
        "ESPN_SWID": "{your-swid}",
        "LEAGUE_ID": "your_league_id",
        "TEAM_ID": "your_team_id"

    }
  }
}
```

## üìä Configuration & Environment Setup

### 1. ESPN Authentication Setup

#### Option A: Browser Cookie Method (Recommended)

1. Login to ESPN Fantasy Football in your browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12) ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies ‚Üí fantasy.espn.com
3. Copy these values:
   - `espn_s2` - Long authentication string
   - `SWID` - UUID with curly braces `{uuid}`

#### Option B: Automated Login (CLI)
The system can attempt automated login using credentials, but may require manual cookie fallback.

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the automation directory:

```bash
# ESPN Authentication
ESPN_S2=your_espn_s2_cookie_value_here
ESPN_SWID={your-swid-uuid-with-braces}

# League Configuration
LEAGUE_ID=your_league_id_number
TEAM_ID=your_team_id_number

# LLM Configuration (choose one)
LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Alternative providers
# LLM_PROVIDER=openai
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic  
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key

# Optional: Advanced Settings
MOCK_MODE=false                    # Set to true for testing without real API calls
CURRENT_SEASON=2025               # NFL season year
DEBUG_LOGGING=true                # Enable detailed logging
```

### 3. GitHub Actions Automation (Optional)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**ESPN Authentication Failures:**
```bash
# Verify cookies are valid
npx tsx src/cli.ts init

# Check league access
npx tsx src/cli.ts roster --league LEAGUE_ID --team TEAM_ID

# Re-authenticate with fresh cookies
# Update .env with new ESPN_S2 and ESPN_SWID values
```

**Common Auth Problems:**
- Cookies expired (ESPN sessions last ~2 hours)
- Wrong league ID (check ESPN URL: `/leagues/{LEAGUE_ID}`)  
- Private league requires authentication
- Team ID mismatch (verify in league roster)

### CLI & System Issues

**Installation Problems:**
```bash
# Clear npm cache and reinstall
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Verify TypeScript and tsx installation
npx tsx --version
```

**Environment Configuration:**
```bash
# Check required environment variables
npx tsx -e "console.log(process.env.ESPN_S2 ? 'ESPN_S2: ‚úì' : 'ESPN_S2: ‚úó')"
npx tsx -e "console.log(process.env.LEAGUE_ID ? 'LEAGUE_ID: ‚úì' : 'LEAGUE_ID: ‚úó')"

# Test LLM provider connection
npx tsx -e "
const config = require('./src/config/llm-config.ts');
config.LLMConfigManager.testConfiguration().then(console.log);
"
```

**Performance Issues:**
- Enable `MOCK_MODE=true` for testing without API calls
- Reduce analysis frequency for cost optimization
- Check network connectivity for ESPN API access

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**Workflow Failures:**
1. Verify all secrets are properly set in repository settings
2. Check workflow logs for specific error messages  
3. Ensure branch protection rules allow workflow execution
4. Validate `.github/workflows/` YAML syntax

**Manual Trigger:**
```bash
# Trigger workflow manually from GitHub Actions tab
# Select "Fantasy Phase 4 Intelligence" workflow
# Click "Run workflow" with desired mode selection
```

## üîí Privacy & Security

### Data Protection
- All ESPN cookies stored locally in `.env` files only
- No credentials transmitted to external services except ESPN
- LLM providers only receive anonymized fantasy data  
- Intelligence results stored locally in JSON format

### Security Best Practices
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Rotate ESPN cookies regularly (every few days)
- Use GitHub Secrets for automation workflows
- Monitor LLM usage costs and set limits

### Rate Limiting & API Usage
- ESPN API: Respectful rate limiting implemented
- LLM Providers: Cost tracking and optimization
- GitHub Actions: Limited to scheduled runs + manual triggers
- Local usage: No external rate limits

## üöÄ Advanced Usage & Development

### Custom Engine Development

Create custom intelligence engines by extending the base engine:

```typescript
// src/engines/customEngine.ts
import { BaseEngine } from './baseEngine';

export class CustomEngine extends BaseEngine {
  async analyze(week: number): Promise<AnalysisResult> {
    // Implement your custom analysis logic
    return {
      insights: ['Custom insight 1', 'Custom insight 2'],
      recommendations: ['Action 1', 'Action 2'],
      confidence: 0.85
    };
  }
}
```

### Historical Data Analysis

Access stored intelligence data:

```bash
# View historical results
ls -la *.json

# Analyze analytics history
cat analytics_history.json | jq '.trends.seasonal_patterns'

# Compare performance over time  
cat phase4_results.json | jq '.intelligence_summary'
```

### Integration with External Tools

**Webhook Integration:**
```bash
# Send results to external webhook
curl -X POST your-webhook-url \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @phase4_results.json
```

**Database Integration:**
- Modify engines to write to PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- Store historical patterns for advanced learning
- Build custom reporting dashboards
